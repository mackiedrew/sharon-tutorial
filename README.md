# Introduction

I decided to start sending you algorithm assignments, they will start simple and get progressively more difficult. You can send them back to me for "marking".

For this purpose we will be using Python 3 (3.6.1 specifically). The reason for this is the super-simple syntax, and the fact that Free Code Camp is teaching you everything else you need. And you will need to know Python.

Python3 is distinct from Python2, so if you are looking up resources online you will need to make sure they are for the appropriate version.

# Python Installation

1. Download [Python 3.6.1](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.1/python-3.6.1-amd64-webinstall.exe)
2. Start the installation file.
3. Make sure to click `Add Python 3.6 to PATH` at the bottom of the installer.
4. Click `Install Now`
5. After installation says `Setup was successful` click `Disable path length limit`
6. Then `Close` the installer

# VSCODE Installation

Everyone developing on their machine, rather than a website like FreeCodeCamp will need to write code in some sort of text editor. You could totally use Notepad, but it's best to find a code-friendly editor.

I like to use `Visual Studio Code`. It is basically just a text editor, but with the ability to become much more with extensions.

1. [Download the latest version](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install through regular means, it's not a tough installation just a normal program.

# Running a Python Script

There are many ways to run a python script, but I'm going to show you a simple way that won't hide anything from you or hold your hand to much.

1. Start the command-prompt, this seems scary but it will be very simple I assure you. You can start the command-prompt going to your search bar in your startmenu and typing the letters `cmd`. This should match `Command Prompt`, now click this. (And create a shortcut on your desktop if you'd like)
2. This is a direct line into your computer's brain. So you are going to have to speak it's language a little bit. Every command prompt has a `current working directory` which basically means the folder it is currently looking at. There is a command called `cd [Folder Name]` which basically means `change directory to [folder name]`. The prompt will start you off at your User directory. So if you want to go to your desktop you can type `cd Desktop` since the `Desktop` folder is in your User.
3. Now add a file to the Desktop called `hello.py` using Visual Studio Code. The `.py` means it is a Python file.
4. In this file put only one line `print("Hello World!")`, save the file.
5. Now in your command promp, use the following command: `python hello.py`
6. You should now see the words `Hello World!` appear in your command prompt. This is how you will see what your programs will do.


# Next Step

You now should read the `Short Guide to Python.md` in this folder. (Open it with Visual Studio Code to see highlighted syntax!)
